# Pomodoro Timer Web Application - Product Definition

## 1. What is a Pomodoro Timer?

A Pomodoro Timer is a time management tool based on the Pomodoro Technique, a method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks (typically 5 minutes). After completing four consecutive work intervals, a longer break (15-30 minutes) is taken. This technique helps maintain focus and mental freshness.

## 2. Problem It Solves

The Pomodoro Timer addresses several common productivity challenges:
- **Procrastination**: By working in short, focused bursts, it makes tasks feel more manageable
- **Burnout**: Regular breaks prevent mental fatigue and maintain consistent productivity
- **Time management**: Helps users estimate and allocate time more effectively
- **Distraction management**: Encourages single-tasking and minimizes context-switching

## 3. Target Users

- **Students**: For focused study sessions and exam preparation
- **Remote workers/Professionals**: To maintain productivity while working from home
- **Freelancers**: For tracking billable hours and maintaining work-life balance
- **Anyone seeking better focus**: People looking to improve their time management and productivity
