# Pomodoro Timer Web Application

A simple and responsive Pomodoro Timer web application built using **React** and **TypeScript**, developed as part of an assignment exploring **vibe coding tools**.  
The project was created using **Windsurf**, an AI-first code editor, to experiment with conversational, context-aware software development.
